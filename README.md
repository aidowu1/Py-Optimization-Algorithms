# Py-Optimization-Algorithms

Optimization_Algorithms is a simple python-based library used to minimize continious domain functions. This library provides a combination of deterministic (classical) and stochastic ( [meta-heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) ) approaches.

This library is currently work in progress..
